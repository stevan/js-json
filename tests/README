This is a message from Ingy to Stevan describing how to set up tests for
a JS-Foo CPAN module.

Follow these steps:

    > sudo cpan JS::Test::Base
    > cd JS-Foo/trunk/
    > mkdir tests
    > cd tests
    > cp `js-cpan Test/Base/Makefile` .
    > cp `js-cpan Test/Base/config.yaml` .
    > vim config.yaml       # Change index_title (and optionally import_libs)
    > mkdir -p lib/Test
    > vim lib/Test/JSON.js  # Make a subclass of Test.Base for testing JSON.js
    > mkdir t
    > vim t/basics.t.js     # See t/basics.t.js
    > # make as many tests as you want
    > make all

NOTE: I did everything for you here except:

    > sudo cpan JS::Test::Base
    > make all

Now you should be able to point your browser at
JS-JSON/trunk/tests/index.html and run the TAP suite in your browser.
Try different browsers.

When you upload your module to CPAN, people can run the tests like this:

    http://search.cpan.org/src/STEVAN/JS-JSON-0.01/tests/index.html

See this example:

    http://search.cpan.org/src/INGY/JS-Test-Base-0.16/tests/index.html

When everything looks good:

    > make clean all
    > cd ..
    > perl Makefile.PL; make manifest; make dist; cpan-upload ...

Enjoy
